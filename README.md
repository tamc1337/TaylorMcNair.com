This is the Github repository for my website. I really need to learn what to put in these readme files, I'm not exactly sure who reads them. 

If you're looking because you're following through on an application I sent in, great work going through the details here, and I hope that my work will, if not convince you of my immediate greatness, will convince you of the potential I posess.
