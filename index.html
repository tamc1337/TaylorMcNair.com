        <h2>My Life story</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy, serving on numerous submarines. After the death of his father in 1953, he left his naval career and returned home to Plains, where he assumed control of his family's peanut-growing business. He inherited comparatively little due to his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate amongst himself and his siblings. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the family's peanut farm was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was encouraged to oppose racial segregation and support the growing civil rights movement. <strong>Oh wait! That was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter"> Jimmy Cater</a>, not Taylor McNair! I get them confused sometimes.</strong></p>
